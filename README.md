# Sitemap retriever
This is a tiny site project built while I was learning golang.  
It involves `parsing xml`, `generate customized error`, `generate customized structs` and `how to add a related function for a struct` which is equivalent to class in Java or python.    

# usage
In order to use it, just go to the directory of this project. Then type `go run main.go`
